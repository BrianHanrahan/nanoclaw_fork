## Integration with Outdoor Activities

### On Surf Days:
- Skip or modify Day 3 (already getting shoulder/core work)
- Consider light lower body the next day if paddling was intense

### On Mountain Bike Days:
- Counts as cardio/lower body work
- Skip or lighten Day 2 or 3 depending on intensity

### On Snowboard Days (Winter):
- Full leg workout - counts as lower body + cardio
- Focus on upper body and recovery the next day

## Progressive Overload Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2:** Focus on form, establish baseline weights
- **Weeks 3-4:** Increase weight by 5-10% when you can complete all sets with good form
- **Weeks 5-6:** Add an extra set to primary lifts OR reduce rest periods
- **Week 7:** Deload week (reduce weight by 20%, maintain volume)
- **Week 8+:** Repeat cycle with heavier starting weights

## Tracking
Track each workout with:
- Exercise name
- Weight used
- Reps completed
- How it felt (RPE 1-10)
- Any PRs or milestones

## Notes
- Warm up: 5 min light cardio + dynamic stretching
- Cool down: 5 min stretching focused on worked muscles
- Adjust volume/intensity based on recovery and outdoor activities
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition for recovery
- Listen to your body - skip or modify if dealing with fatigue or soreness
